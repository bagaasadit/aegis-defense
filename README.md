**Aegis System Defense** is an advanced security utility for Termux designed to instantly hide applications and sensitive folders using low-level system manipulation. 

The **Hybrid Edition** integrates Android package state control (`pm disable`) with stealthy filesystem masking, ensuring your private data remains invisible even if your device falls into the wrong hands.

## 🚦 Operational Logic

| Mode | Sentinel Status | Effect |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Lockdown** (`st h`) | 🔴 OFF | All target apps and folders are completely hidden. |
| **Unlock** (`st u`) | 🟢 ACTIVE | System is accessible but monitored. Closing Termux triggers auto-lock. |
| **Free Roam** (`st free`) | ⚪ DISABLED | Protection disabled. Apps stay visible even after Termux is closed. |

## 🛠️ How the Sentinel Works

The Aegis Sentinel runs as a background process. It is designed to trigger a **Lockdown** sequence if any of the following events are detected:
1. **Screen Off:** User presses the power button or screen times out.
2. **Session Kill:** Termux is swiped away from the "Recent Apps" list.
3. **OOM Kill:** Android OS kills Termux to reclaim memory.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool modifies Android system package states. Use at your own risk. Always remember which applications or folders you have hidden before uninstalling the script or clearing Termux data.
